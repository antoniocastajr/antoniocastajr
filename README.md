## 🧑‍💻 Antonio's coding path 🛣️

My journey into the world of coding began during my dual bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Business, driven by a passion to understand every corner of programming. I started with Java, where I learned the foundations of data structures, classes, objects, and inheritance. Building on this base, I explored Assembler and C, guided by courses such as Operating Systems and Distributed Systems, which helped me see how these languages connect to the inner workings of computing. In the later years of my degree, I turned my focus to Python and the field of Data Science, an area that perfectly bridges my technical and business background, while also fueling my curiosity. Today, I continue this path by sharing projects on Data Science, AI Agents, and Large Language Models (LLMs) here on GitHub, documenting everything I learn along the way

## 🧑‍💻 Antonio's Projects 🔬

#### 🔭 Currently Working On  

- 🤖 **[Naviria][naviria]** → A personal AI assistant that integrates **LLMs, memory, and external APIs** for smart task automation.

#
#### ✋ On Hold

- 📘 **[Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch][machine]** → A hands-on project where I build classic **machine learning algorithms completely from scratch,** while also **breaking down the math and theory behind them.** So far, I’ve implemented Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and PCA and **compare my results with Sklearn.** This is an ongoing project, and whenever I get some free time, I plan to expand it with Random Forest, SVM, and KNN.

#
#### 🌟 Projects that you should take a peak at

- 🧾 **[Fraud Detection Using PySpark][fraud]** → Credit card transactions were classified into fraud and non-fraud by analyzing client behavior through a **variety of machine learning models,** including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. To support this process, **features were engineered and selected using correlation analysis, visual inspection, and chi-square tests,** ensuring that only the most relevant attributes were retained. These inputs were then integrated into end-to-end **pipelines,** which streamlined data transformations and automated predictions.

  Building on these foundations, the **three best-performing models—Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM—were combined into an ensemble using majority voting, leading to a 40.44% improvement in the F1-Score.** To provide transparency and deeper insights, model interpretability was finally addressed using the **SHAP library,** which explained feature contributions and the reasoning behind predictions.
