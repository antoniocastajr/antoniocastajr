# 🚀 Antonio's coding path

---

My journey into the world of coding began during my dual bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Business, driven by a passion to understand every corner of programming. I started with Java, where I learned the foundations of data structures, classes, objects, and inheritance. Building on this base, I explored Assembler and C, guided by courses such as Operating Systems and Distributed Systems, which helped me see how these languages connect to the inner workings of computing. In the later years of my degree, I turned my focus to Python and the field of Data Science, an area that perfectly bridges my technical and business background, while also fueling my curiosity. Today, I continue this path by sharing projects on Data Science, AI Agents, and Large Language Models (LLMs) here on GitHub, documenting everything I learn along the way

## On Hold

- 📘 **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch** → A hands-on project where I build classic **machine learning algorithms completely from scratch,** while also **breaking down the math and theory behind them.** So far, I’ve implemented *Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and PCA.* This is an ongoing project, and whenever I get some free time, I plan to expand it with *Random Forest, SVM, and KNN.*
